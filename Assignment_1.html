     <p> Hello, I am Mok Wing Laam, Nelly. Thank you for clicking my journal! This is my first time creating a webpage. You can view my website <a href="https://laam923.github.io/Assignment-one-website/" style="color:orange">here.</a>
     <br> </br>
    As a beginner in HTML and CSS, it is not easy to create a website starting from zero. It seems easy to follow Bernard’s instructions during the pre-course workshops, but I encountered many difficulties when it comes to hands-on practice. I have watched some Youtube tutorials and asked some of my friends who have an IT background. I learned that creating a website is not an easy job, the knowledge that a website developer involved in planning, designing, and developing a website requires a huge amount of effort and skills. 
     <br> </br>
   Although my website is simple and it does not contain much content and styles, I spent long hours fixing the margin and paddings in each section. I have used some techniques that I discovered online such as adopting linear-gradient in my website’s background etc. Also, I have used different shades of green to differentiate the assignment pages, from the darkest green on the main page to the lightest green on assignment 5’s page. It represents that I am gaining more and more knowledge in the learning process and it is hoped that I will not be so confused after taking this course. 
     <br> </br>
   One thing to improve is that I am still relying on the pictures and icons searched online, I hope I can create my own banners to decorate my website using Photoshop next time. Thank you for reviewing my website and please feel free to comment on my work! </p>
